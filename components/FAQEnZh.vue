      <h5>Can I access the courses in China?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>
          Web pages can be opened normally in China without VPN. Since the
          server is not in China, the speed may be slower when loading a page
          for the first time. Please patiently wait for up to one minute, the
          second load speed will be very fast. Video is provided by
          Wistia&rsquo;s dedicated CDN network, so the loading speed of video is
          very fast. Browsers like Safari, Chrome or Firefox are recommended,
          while browsers like QQ, Baidu and UC are not recommended.

          digital products like an online course) to a customer based in Europe.
          So if you&rsquo;re based in EU, we are required to charge VAT. All of
          our prices are VAT-inclusive.
