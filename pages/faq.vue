                Nevertheless, the community behind zerotohero.ca wants to be on
                good terms with all content creators. If you wish to have your

              <h5>How can I prevent my videos from showing up on this site?</h5>
              <p>
                By allowing websites like zerotohero.ca, your videos will get
                views and generate ad revenue for you as if the videos are
                viewed on YouTube. The YouTube embed player on this website also
                recommends other videos from you channel, which can potentially
                give you additional views. What's more, by allowing your videos
                on this site you are helping the language-learning community
                with your great content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having said that, if you still wish to remove your video, you
                can do so in the following ways:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Restrict embedding for specific websites.</b>
                  You can blacklist certain domains (such as www.zerotohero.ca)
                  to prevent them from displaying your YouTube videos. For
                  instructions, see

                <li>
                  <b>Turn off embedding for a specific video.</b>
                  By turning off embedding for a specific video, you will stop
                  all websites from displaying that video. Once you turn off
                  embedding, the video will no longer play on any website and
                  instead display an error message. See
